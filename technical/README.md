Some variations of runs done after the initial release, but put here for convienence


## rolling_fpw
tried turnning the footprint weight way up. Indeed, that fixes the rolling, but now we're at very high airmass and the filters ignore the moon to a large extent.  Did a footprint weight of 4.0, rather than the usual 0.6

## roll_weight_tune

Try out different footprint weights, and contiguous vs non-contiguous blobs. Going to start with the no-N/S modulo for this.

Maybe weights of 0.6, 0.9, 1.2, 1.5, 1.8, 2.1, 2.4, 2.7, 3.0

A second pass at using twilight time to execute a NEO survey. The NEO survey takes 1s exposures in r,i, or z. Observations are attempted in triples (same filter), spaced ~3 minutes apart.  

NOTE! We have not checked with data management or the camera team to verify that we can actually operate the telescope in this mode! Reading the camera this often could result in thermal control issues. Also, this may produce more data than our pipeline can handle. 

Taking 1s exposures is more inefficient, and if we give all twilight time over to the NEO survey we can fail to meet SRD requirements. We therefore vary the fraction of nights the NEO survey is allowed to execute. The patterns are
1: All nights
2: 1 night on, 1 off
3: 1 on, 2 off
4: 1 on, 3 off
5: 4 on, 4 off
6: 3 on, 4 off
7: 2 on, 4 off
